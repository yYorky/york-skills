## 1. Voice & Tone Overview

York writes with three distinct tones depending on the topic. Select the tone that
fits the article's purpose and what was confirmed in Q6 of the interview.

**CFO-Analytical**
Data-forward, ROI-grounded, risk-aware. Uses numbers and frameworks to expose the
gap between what companies say they're doing and what the numbers actually show.
Authoritative without being preachy. Comfortable naming uncomfortable truths.

**Personal / Story-Driven**
Opens with a lived experience — a parenting moment, a client situation, something
from his CFO or engineering days. Moves inward (the specific situation) before
moving outward (the generalised principle). Warm but never soft.

**Cautionary / Mentoring**
Written as though advising a smart colleague who is about to make a common mistake.
Identifies a trap the industry is falling into. Slows the reader down before they
act. Ends by redirecting energy toward a better path, not just diagnosing the problem.

**Cross-cutting character (applies to all three tones):**
- Conversational but authoritative — never condescending
- Earns credibility through specificity, not title-dropping
- Varies sentence length deliberately: complex ideas followed by short punchy sentences
- Questions assumptions before offering solutions
- Concrete examples before abstract principles

## 2. Opening Patterns

York uses one of three opening types. Match the type to the tone and topic.

### Type A — Personal Anecdote
**Structure:** Scene-setting sentence (when/where/what) → action or observation → insight it revealed

The scene must feel specific — a real moment, not a composite or hypothetical.
The insight should be stated plainly at the end of the opening paragraph, not buried.

**Template:**
> [Specific situation, grounded in time/place/role]. [What happened or what I noticed].
> [The insight this revealed, stated directly.]

**When to use:** Personal/Story-Driven tone; when York has a lived example from Q3
that directly illustrates the article's core argument.

---

### Type B — Striking Statistic
**Structure:** Drop the stat with attribution → contextualise why it's surprising or
counterintuitive → connect directly to the article's thesis

The stat must challenge an assumption or reveal a gap — not just be a large number.
State the source inline (e.g., "according to PwC's 2024 survey").

**Template:**
> [Stat], according to [source]. Yet most [audience] are [doing the opposite / still
> behaving as if the old assumption holds]. [One sentence connecting this to what
> the article will argue.]

**When to use:** CFO-Analytical tone; when research links from Q4 provide usable data.

---

### Type C — Paradox or Stated Contrast
**Structure:** Short declarative sentence that states a tension → one sentence expanding
the paradox → a question that pulls the reader forward

York's signature contrast format: "[Thing A] doesn't mean [Thing B]" or "The faster
we [X], the less we actually [Y]."

**Template:**
> [Counterintuitive claim stated as a short sentence]. [Expand: why this is true,
> or what the tension actually is]. [Question that the rest of the article will answer.]

**When to use:** Cautionary/Mentoring tone; when the article's core insight is a
challenge to a widely-held assumption.

---

## 3. Structural Template

Every article follows this five-part arc. Adapt section depth to the chosen length.

**1. Opening Hook** (1–2 paragraphs)
One of the three types above. Ends with a clear statement of what the article is about.

**2. Problem Statement** (1–2 paragraphs)
Frame the problem clearly. State who it affects and why it has been under-addressed
or misdiagnosed. Avoid dramatising — state it plainly. Do not moralize.

**3. Root Causes or Dimensions** (the body — 40–50% of total words)
- For **long-form**: 2–4 items with `##` sub-headers; each gets 2–3 paragraphs
- For **medium-form**: 2–3 items flowing as prose paragraphs with transitional phrases
  (e.g., "The second issue is...", "Beneath that sits a more fundamental problem:")

Each cause should be specific, not generic. Tie to real business behaviour when possible.

**4. Solutions or Reframes** (20–30% of total words)
Concrete and constraint-aware. Acknowledge what makes this hard before offering the path
forward. Do not list solutions that assume unlimited resources or perfect conditions.
Ground them in real decisions an actual organisation can make.

**5. Closing** (1–2 paragraphs)
Two acceptable closing moves — choose one:
- **Generalise upward:** Extract a broader principle from the specific topic. The closing
  sentence should be standalone and quotable without context.
- **Reframe as opportunity:** Flip the problem into what becomes possible if the reader
  acts differently. End on forward momentum, not diagnosis.

Do NOT use a "Conclusion" sub-header. Do NOT close with "I'd love to hear your thoughts"
as the main final statement — it can appear after a substantive closing sentence, but
never as a substitute for one.

## 4. Vocabulary Guide

### Preferred — business-technical
ROI, process redesign, constraints, tradeoffs, leverage point, decision rights,
operating model, unit economics, resource allocation, case for change, accountability

### Preferred — human-centered
Judgment, trust, friction, ownership, adoption, capacity, intent, context, incentives

### Preferred — practitioner register
Pilot, operationalise, instrument, course-correct, embed, measure, iterate, baseline

### Words and phrases to avoid
| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Revolutionary, game-changer, disruptive | Hype register; York argues against this framing |
| Paradigm shift, ecosystem | Vague and overused |
| Leverage synergies, move the needle | Consulting filler |
| Unlock your potential / unlock value | Generic |
| In today's rapidly evolving landscape | The most common LinkedIn opener cliché |
| Thought leadership | Self-referential; show, don't claim |
| It could be argued, arguably | Hedging that weakens the point |

## 5. Thematic Signature

York's seven recurring intellectual commitments. Surface these naturally when they fit
the topic — do not force them into every article.

**Pragmatism over hype**
Always asks: does this actually work under real business constraints, with real people,
in a real organisation? Celebrates the boring, effective solution over the impressive one.

**Business alignment first**
Technology, AI, and process changes earn their place by connecting to financial or
strategic outcomes. The business question comes before the technology question.

**Skepticism of conventional wisdom**
Identifies where default industry advice is incomplete, premature, or context-dependent.
Comfortable being the person who says "slow down" when everyone else is accelerating.

**Human-centered decision-making**
Technology and process change succeed or fail based on whether people actually adopt them.
Incentives, culture, and trust matter as much as the technical solution.

**Parenting as a credibility lens**
Uses parenting analogies to explain complex tradeoffs, long-term thinking, or the gap
between effort and outcome. Always grounded in a specific moment — not "as a parent"
as a generic badge, but "when my daughter was three months old and..."

**CFO lens**
Frames costs, risks, and ROI explicitly. Skeptical of vanity metrics (engagement, downloads,
AI tool adoption rates that don't trace to outcomes). Comfortable with payback periods,
unit economics, and the discipline of measuring what matters.

**Practitioner identity**
York both strategises and builds. He has shipped production AI tools — RAG chatbots,
multimodal LLM applications, demand-forecasting models — while also having run a P&L
as CFO and now leading AI adoption in a government agency. This dual credibility
(executive and engineer) distinguishes him from pure strategists or pure technologists.
Reference when directly relevant. Do not force it where it does not fit.

## 6. Annotated Examples

These are constructed examples that demonstrate the patterns above. They are not
excerpts from published articles.

---

### CFO-Analytical tone example

> Only 44% of AI investments in finance functions are delivering measurable ROI,
> according to Deloitte's 2024 CFO survey. The surprising part isn't the number —
> it's that most finance leaders already suspected this and approved the budgets anyway.
> The problem isn't the technology. It's that we stopped asking the CFO question:
> what, exactly, are we trying to improve, and how will we know if we did?

**Notes:**
- Opens with a stat that challenges an assumption (low ROI despite awareness)
- Short punchy sentence after the data to land the key tension
- Closes the opening paragraph with the thesis as a question, not a statement
- "The CFO question" establishes York's perspective without claiming the label

---

### Personal / Story-Driven tone example

> Three months into fatherhood, I was running four different apps to track feeds,
> naps, and diaper changes. I had a spreadsheet. I had a Notion dashboard.
> I was optimising a system that my daughter had no interest in respecting.
> The lesson that took me too long to learn: the most important variable wasn't
> in any of my trackers. It was whether I was paying attention to her, not to the data.

**Notes:**
- Specific scene (three months, specific tools) — not a vague "as a new parent"
- Self-deprecating; York is the subject of the lesson, not the teacher dispensing wisdom
- Short final sentence delivers the insight after a build-up
- No jargon — the translation to business is left for the next paragraph

---

### Cautionary / Mentoring tone example

> Adopting AI quickly and adopting AI wisely are not the same thing — and right now,
> most organisations are confusing the two. The pressure to show progress is real.
> But velocity without direction is just movement, and movement is easy to report
> while being almost impossible to reverse once the technical debt accumulates.
> Before your next AI pilot, ask one question: what decision will this change?

**Notes:**
- Opens with a contrast ("not the same thing") — Type C opening
- Mentoring register: "before your next AI pilot" addresses the reader directly
- Acknowledges the pressure the reader is under before offering the reframe
- Closes with a single actionable question, not a list of recommendations

## 7. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-pattern | What to do instead |
|---|---|
| Generic LinkedIn opener ("In today's rapidly evolving...") | Open with a stat, a specific scene, or a stated paradox |
| Passive problem framing ("Many organisations struggle with...") | Name the problem directly and state why it matters |
| Buzzword density (>2 buzzwords per paragraph) | Use plain language; if a term needs explaining, it probably shouldn't be there |
| Unsupported superlatives ("the biggest challenge facing...") | Either quantify it or remove the superlative |
| Bullet-point padding | York's articles flow as prose; use lists only for genuinely enumerable items |
| Weak closing ("I'd love to hear your thoughts") | End with a substantive sentence first; the engagement invitation is optional and secondary |
| Forced credibility markers | Only reference CFO background, parenting, or builder identity when it fits naturally |
| Lecturing tone | York is a peer sharing what he has learned, not an authority issuing verdicts |

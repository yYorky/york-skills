# York's Claude Skills Library

A personal library of Claude Code skills for personal productivity and creative work.

## How to use

1. Browse the skills below and find what you need
2. Copy the skill folder into `.claude/skills/` in your project:
   ```bash
   cp -r path/to/york-skills/skill-name ./your-project/.claude/skills/
   ```
3. Invoke with `/skill-name` in Claude Code

> **Note:** The `skill-creator` skill is also built into Claude Code natively — you can invoke `/skill-creator` on any machine without copying it first. The copy here is for reference and customisation.
